# Constantina - Github CV

I'm a JavaScript developer, Founders and Coders (FAC) graduate, and former academic in the field of experimental physics. I discovered programming because I was interested in learning about data science, and it has become my passion since I started preparing for my application to the FAC programme.

Some projects I've worked on:
* A questionnaire for young people with mental health problems, for [Anna Freud](http://www.annafreud.org/) : https://github.com/FAC-11/AllAboutMe
* A multiplayer - shooter game, using websockets and pure JavaScript : [Gunboat Diplomacy](https://github.com/FAC-11/FACgame)

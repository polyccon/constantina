# Constantina - Github CV

I'm a JavaScript developer graduating from Founders and Coders (FAC) in October and former academic in the field of experimental physics. I discovered programming because I was interested in data science, and it has become my passion since I started preparing for FAC last winter.

* Currently working on a project for young people with mental health problems, for Anna Freud: https://github.com/FAC-11/AllAboutMe
* Here is a link to the most recent project I've worked on: https://github.com/FAC-11/FACgame

## My current tech stack
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Testing with Tape and supertest
* Database postgreSQL
* Authentication: bcrypt and JSON Web Token
* Heroku
* Markdown
* HTML5/ CSS3


## Have also used
* Websockets with __socket.io__
* __Three.js__
* __Babel__ for transpiling code to cross-browser compatible
* __Browserify/watchify__ for bundling frontend files
* Continuous integration using __Travis__

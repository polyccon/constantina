I'm a JavaScript developer, Founders and Coders (FAC) graduate, and former
academic in the field of experimental physics. I discovered programming because
I was interested in learning about data science, and it has become my passion
since I started preparing for my application to the FAC programme. I'm looking
for the right place where I can keep learning about programming while solving
interesting problems, surrounded by inspiring people, in a nice and supportive
work environment.

Some projects I've worked on:

* A questionnaire for young people with mental health problems, for the [Anna
  Freud](http://www.annafreud.org/) charity [All about
  me](https://github.com/FAC-11/AllAboutMe)
* A multiplayer - shooter game, using websockets and pure JavaScript : [Gunboat
  Diplomacy](https://github.com/FAC-11/FACgame)

![founders and coders](https://www.coops.tech/app/uploads/2016/12/CT_Logo_Founders_Coders.png)

* 17 week web development bootcamp at **_Founders and Coders_**, London

* **_Ph.D. in Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy_** (experimental physics).
  L.E.N.S., INO-CNR and Univesity of Florence, Italy.

  Thesis title: “Adaptive detection of arbitrarily shaped ultrashort quantum
  light states”

It was about a novel experimental technique combining Quantum and Ultrafast
Optics, designed to detect and fully characterise any shape of any quantum
ultrashort light state, in an adaptive way, without the need of any preliminary
information (as was previously necessary). The adaptive aspect of the detector
was facilitated by making use of a **_Genetic Algorithm_** -one of the real life
applications of _Machine Learning_ concepts.

* **_Degree in Physics (BSc/MSc)_**. Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

  I took 54 exams in a wide range of scientific topics (i.e. Theoretical and
  Quantum Mechanics, Optics, Astronomy, Thermodynamics, Atomic Physics, Nuclear
  Physics, Electromagnetism, Analytical geometry/vector calculus, Chemistry,
  Physic and Philosophy, Advanced Calculus, Differential Equations etc.)

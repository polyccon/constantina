Hi, I'm Constantina, a physicist, problem solver and data engineer. I obtained my PhD in atomic and molecular spectroscopy from LENS and the University of Florence, where I developed a detector utilising supervised learning and genetic algorithms to retrieve adaptively the spectrotemporal profile of quantum light states, allowing them to be measured for the first time without any prior information or preparation. Fascinated by data science and passionate about programming, I got into the ASI Data Science fellowship programme. For my project, I worked their SherlockML engineering team, where I built an automatic machine learning service, in the form of an API. I’m looking for the right place where I can learn about distributed systems, build robust pipelines that handle flows of data, create interesting visualisations, or in general, solve interesting problems while surrounded by inspiring people, in a nice and supportive work environment.

My ASI Fellowship project:

* Buit and deployed an automatic machine learning API, hosted on the SherlockML platform. Tech stack: Python framework Flask, postgres and rq

Some other projects I've worked on:

* An express/handlebars/postgres boilerplate: [Boilerplate](https://github.com/polyccon/boilerplate)
* A questionnaire for young people with mental health problems, for the [Anna
  Freud](http://www.annafreud.org/) charity [All about
  me](https://github.com/FAC-11/AllAboutMe)
* A multiplayer - shooter game, using websockets and pure JavaScript : [Gunboat
  Diplomacy](https://github.com/FAC-11/FACgame)

![founders and coders](https://www.coops.tech/app/uploads/2016/12/CT_Logo_Founders_Coders.png)

* 17 week web development bootcamp at **_Founders and Coders_**, London

* **_Ph.D. in Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy_** (experimental physics).
  L.E.N.S., INO-CNR and Univesity of Florence, Italy.

  Thesis title: “Adaptive detection of arbitrarily shaped ultrashort quantum
  light states”

It was about a novel experimental technique combining Quantum and Ultrafast
Optics, designed to detect and fully characterise any shape of any quantum
ultrashort light state, in an adaptive way, without the need of any preliminary
information (as was previously necessary). The adaptive aspect of the detector
was facilitated by making use of a **_Genetic Algorithm_** -one of the real life
applications of _Machine Learning_ concepts.

* **_Degree in Physics (BSc/MSc)_**. Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

  I took 54 exams in a wide range of scientific topics (i.e. Theoretical and
  Quantum Mechanics, Optics, Astronomy, Thermodynamics, Atomic Physics, Nuclear
  Physics, Electromagnetism, Analytical geometry/vector calculus, Chemistry,
  Physic and Philosophy, Advanced Calculus, Differential Equations etc.)

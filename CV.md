# Constantina Polycarpou - Github CV

I'm a JavaScript developer graduating from Founders and Coders (FAC) in October and former academic in the field of experimental physics. I discovered programming because I was interested in data science, and it has become my passion since I started preparing for FAC last winter.

* Ph.D. in Experimental Physics, Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy in particular. L.E.N.S., INO-CNR and Univesity of Florence, Italy.
Thesis title: “Adaptive detection of arbitrarily shaped ultrashort quantum light states”

* Degree in Physics (BSc/MSc). Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
I took 54 exams in a wide range of scientific topics (i.e. Theoretical and Quantum Mechanics, Optics, Astronomy,
Thermodynamics, Atomic Physics, Nuclear Physics, Electromagnetism, Analytical geometry/vector calculus, Chemistry, Physic and Philosophy, Advanced Calculus, Differential Equations etc.)

## Foreign Languages
* English
* Greek
* Italian 
* Spanish
* French (some)

## Work Experience
* Node week-2 mentor at Founders and Coders - November 2017
* Full Stack JavaScript Developer, Founders & Coders (2017 - Present)
* Data & Insights Manager London, (2016)
* Academic research in Nanomedicine (science), in France (2014)
* Academic research in Quantum Optics (science), in Florence, Italy (2013)

## Other interests

When not at FAC or codebar or other coding meetups, I might be doing one of the following:

* Running -long distance.
* Looking for records, techno, house, idm, breakbeat, electro, etc
* I'm a member of the Florentine Caving Group and Italian Alpinian Club, also the only foreigner. However, as I'm not currently in Florence I need to looking for groups locally.
* Reading psychology books.
* Cinema and photography.
* Volunteering: I would really like to save the planet, please give me a hand.

My Data Engineering project with ASI Data Science:

* Buit and deployed an automatic machine learning API, hosted on the SherlockML platform. Tech stack: Python framework Flask, postgreSQL and rq

Some other projects I've worked on:

* An express/handlebars/postgres boilerplate: [Boilerplate](https://github.com/polyccon/boilerplate)
* A questionnaire for young people with mental health problems, for the [Anna
  Freud](http://www.annafreud.org/) charity [All about
  me](https://github.com/FAC-11/AllAboutMe)
* A multiplayer - shooter game, using websockets and pure JavaScript : [Gunboat
  Diplomacy](https://github.com/FAC-11/FACgame)

* 2018, __Data Engineering__ project with the SherlockM engineering team,  at ASI Data Science.

SherlockML is a data science development platform, developed by ASI Data Science.  I 
developed an automatic machine learning [API](https://hopper.api.sherlockml.io)  using 
Python, Flask, Postgres and rq.- ask me for a key. I used a dataset from the Higgs boson 
experiment, as well as the well-known MNIST handwritten digits both for research and 
development parts of the project. 
I presented the results of this work to 250 people from the industry, at the ASI Demo Day 
event, 9th March 2018. 

* 2017, Backend Engineer in Node at Filament, Machine Learning and AI company, London

I worked on the backend of a chatbot developed to serve the clients of a big company.


* 2017, __Node week-2 mentor__ at Founders and Coders - November 2017

Mentor for the 2nd week of Node, teaching error handling, shell scripting and testing.


* 2017, __Full Stack JavaScript Developer__, Founders & Coders, London

Freelance developer and project co-manager of All about me, a webapp developed 
following the agile methodology process,  for young people with mental health 
problems for Anna Freud UK, charity.


* 2016 - 17,	__Data & Insights Manager__, London

Managed and maintained the database of a small company in London.


* 2014-15, __Research fellow__, University Franche-Comte, France

Organised the optics lab and worked on the construction of a microscope for the study of 
human skin cells.


* 2013, __Research fellow__ in Quantum Optics (science), in Florence, Italy

Worked on the experiment of my PhD, creating and characterising hyperentangled states


* 2008- 2009, __European Commission trainee__, INFSO Directorate General, Photonics Unit

Trainee in communications, Photonics Unit, managing the European budget for research in Photonics.

* **__ASI Data Science__** Fellowship, London

· Highly selective eight week ‘academia to industry’ Data Science and Machine Learning 
  conversion course given by ASI Data Science.
· Two weeks of intensive classroom based training at ASI Data Science followed by a 
  five week Data Science and Engineering    project at ASI’s data science platform, 
  SherlockML. Final week spent preparing project presentation.
· Topics covered: programming in Python 3 for Data Science (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), 
  current Machine Learning algorithms and their application to commercial and industrial 
  problems, distributed computing with Spark and Hadoop, Databases relational and 
  non-relational (SQL and MongoDB), commercial acumen and business skills, presentation 
  training.

* 17 week web development bootcamp at **_Founders and Coders_**, London

  Open source ethics and peer-led learning underpin the 16-week course, with a 
  heavy emphasis on pair programming and thorough documentation.
  During the first half, each week culminates in a 2-day project that is delivered 
  in small agile teams dedicated to the following topics: Version control and 
  Accessibility, Testing, Apis, Node, Node week 2, Database, Authentication and Express

* **_Ph.D. in Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy_** (experimental physics).
  L.E.N.S., INO-CNR and Univesity of Florence, Italy.

  Developed a detector utilising supervised learning and genetic algorithms to 
  retrieve adaptively the spectrotemporal profile of quantum light states, 
  allowing them to be measured for the first time without any prior information 
  or preparation. One of the real life Machine Learning applications.


* **_Degree in Physics (BSc/MSc)_**. Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

  54 exams in a wide range of scientific topics (i.e. Theoretical and
  Quantum Mechanics, Optics, Astronomy, Thermodynamics, Atomic Physics, Nuclear
  Physics, Electromagnetism, Analytical geometry/vector calculus, Chemistry,
  Physic and Philosophy, Advanced Calculus, Differential Equations etc.)
